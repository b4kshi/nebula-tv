### 3. **Technical Approach**

### 4. **User Stories/Scenarios**

- **App Discovery**: User quickly finds, launches, or favorites any installed app from the home grid.
- **Cross-Device Browsing**: User starts a tab on their phone and seamlessly opens it on TV via Firefox Sync.
- **Personal News**: User adds their favorite research RSS feeds and sees new headlines on the home screen.
- **Focus & Aesthetic**: TV displays a mesmerizing, ever-changing cosmic scene as a background or full-screen screensaver.
- **Universal Navigation**: Everything is smooth and controlled via TV remote, minimizing clicks/swipes.

### 5. **Success Metrics**
